# Bubble Test AutoGrader

This project attempts to create a Auto Grader for MCQ test where answers are supposed to be filled in by the student.

We use contour detection techniques to find the answer options and then check which option has been filled in. We then check with the answer key to calculate the students score. Which is displayed on the top left of the paper.
